For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Wearing a helmet was associated with higher risk-takingscores (M = 40.40, SD = 18.18) than wearing a cap (M =31.06, SD = 13.29), t(78) = 2.63, p = .01, d = 0.59 (Fig. 2a).Similarly, participants who wore a helmet reported highersensation-seeking scores (M = 23.23, SD = 7.00) than participantswho wore a cap (M = 18.78, SD = 5.09), Welch’st(69.19) = 3.24, p = .002, d = 0.73 (Fig. 2b). These effectscannot be explained by the helmet affecting anxiety, asanxiety did not change significantly as a function of condition,F(1, 78) = 0.19, p = .66, time of measurement, F(2,156) = 2.37, p = .10, or an interaction between the two,F(2, 156) = 1.18, p = .31 (Fig. 2c). Note that we used thesquare roots of the anxiety scores for analyses because ofthe skew seen in Figure 2c. There was no relationshipbetween risk taking and gender, t(78) = 0.45, p = .66, bicyclingexperience (ρ = .12, p = .27), and extent of helmetuse when bicycling (ρ = .06, p = .60)
